# Script Optimization Summary

## What Was Changed

The project initialization and setup scripts have been completely optimized to eliminate hardcoded references and improve reusability.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Dynamic Project Configuration System**
- Created `scripts/project-config.sh` - centralized configuration management
- Added `.project-config` file to store project settings after initialization
- All scripts now dynamically adapt to the actual project name

#### 2. **Enhanced init.sh**
- Now creates and manages `.project-config` file
- Prevents accidental re-initialization with confirmation
- Supports port re-generation while preserving project names
- Better error handling for partially renamed projects

#### 3. **Made All Scripts Project-Agnostic**
- **dev-setup.sh**: Uses dynamic database names, ports, and display names
- **dev-status.sh**: Adapts dashboard title and port information
- **dev-tools.sh**: Uses dynamic database names for all operations

#### 4. **New Master Setup Script**
- Created `scripts/setup.sh` - orchestrates the entire setup process
- Automatically detects if project is initialized
- Provides granular control (init-only, dev-setup-only, force-init)

#### 5. **Removed Redundant Scripts**
- Deleted `scripts/dev-setup-original.sh`
- Deleted `scripts/prod-deploy-original.sh`

## New Workflow

### For New Projects (Recommended)
```bash
# One command does everything
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Manual Workflow
```bash
# 1. Initialize project (rename from template)
./scripts/init.sh

# 2. Set up development environment  
./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

### Project Management
```bash
# Check project status
./scripts/project-config.sh show

# Re-initialize with new ports
./scripts/setup.sh --force-init

# Just setup dev environment
./scripts/setup.sh --dev-setup-only
```

## Benefits

### ✅ **Fixed Issues**
- Scripts no longer break after running `init.sh`
- No more hardcoded "IntranetStarter" or "intranet_starter" references
- Proper port management across all scripts
- Consistent project naming throughout

### ✅ **Improved Developer Experience**
- Single command setup for new projects
- Automatic detection of project state
- Clear error messages and guidance
- Prevents accidental data loss

### ✅ **Better Template Reusability**
- True template behavior - works for any project name
- Automatic adaptation to custom configurations
- Proper separation of concerns between scripts

## Technical Implementation

### Project Configuration Structure
```bash
# .project-config (created by init.sh)
SOLUTION_NAME="my_project"           # snake_case solution name
NAMESPACE_NAME="MyProject"           # PascalCase C# namespace  
DISPLAY_NAME="My Project"            # Title Case display name
POSTGRES_PORT="12345"                # Randomized ports
REDIS_PORT="12346"
SMTP_WEB_PORT="12347" 
SMTP_PORT="12348"
PROJECT_INITIALIZED=true
INIT_DATE="2025-01-15 10:30:45"
```

### Dynamic Reference Pattern
All scripts now use patterns like:
```bash
# Old (hardcoded)
DB_NAME=intranet_starter_dev

# New (dynamic)
DB_NAME="${SOLUTION_NAME:-intranet_starter}_dev"
```

This ensures backward compatibility while enabling dynamic behavior.

## Migration Notes

- Existing projects can run `./scripts/setup.sh --force-init` to upgrade
- The `.project-config` file should be committed to version control
- Old environment files will be automatically updated during setup
