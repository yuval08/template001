## Next Priority Items

Based on the implementation roadmap, the next critical items should be:

1. **Global Loading States** - Centralized loading management with skeleton loaders
2. **Toast Notification System** - Enhanced user feedback for all operations  
3. **Performance Optimizations** - Route-based code splitting and component optimization
4. **Enhanced Error Boundaries** - Better error handling with recovery mechanisms

## Critical Security Issue (High Priority)

⚠️ **Authorization Filtering Required**: The universal search currently returns ALL projects and user data to any authenticated user, regardless of permissions. This requires immediate attention before production deployment.

**Required Action**: Implement user context filtering in search queries to respect role-based access control.
