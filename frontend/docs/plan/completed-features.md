## Next Priority Items

Based on the implementation roadmap, the next critical items should be:

1. **User Profile Dropdown** - Settings and logout functionality in top navigation
2. **Online/Offline Detection** - Network status monitoring and connectivity indicators  
3. **Global Loading States** - Centralized loading management with skeleton loaders
4. **Toast Notification System** - Enhanced user feedback for all operations
5. **Network Status Recovery** - App locking mechanism for offline state with retry functionality

## Critical Security Issue (High Priority)

⚠️ **Authorization Filtering Required**: The universal search currently returns ALL projects and user data to any authenticated user, regardless of permissions. This requires immediate attention before production deployment.

**Required Action**: Implement user context filtering in search queries to respect role-based access control.
