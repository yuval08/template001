# Intranet Starter Template

## ðŸš€ Quick Start - Template Initialization

**This is a project template.** Follow these steps to create your own project:

### Step 1: Get the Template
```bash
# Clone or download this template
git clone <your-template-repo-url> my-new-project
cd my-new-project
```

### Step 2: Initialize Your Project
```bash
# Run the master setup script - this will:
# 1. Ask for your project name (e.g., "company_portal")
# 2. Rename all files and namespaces
# 3. Generate random ports to avoid conflicts
# 4. Set up development environment
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Step 3: Start Developing
```bash
# Your project is ready! Access:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# - API: http://localhost:5000
# - Database: localhost:<generated-port>
```

That's it! Your personalized project is ready. Continue reading for detailed information about the technology stack and features.
